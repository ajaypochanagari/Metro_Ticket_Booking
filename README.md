IDEA:- 
My idea is to provide an application that helps people to by tickets without waiting in 
a line and wasting their time. 
Easily they can create their cards and delete cards. 
The information of person with name and mobile number with their tickets. 
It is implemented using Files and Data Structure – Singly Linked List. 

People don’t have proper access to get tickets .
Ticket agent doesn’t contain the people information for further notifications. 
Develop a C program to store details of bookings of tickets. The application also provides the 
following mentioned functionalities: 
There are five options 
 1.view Stations 
 2. Buy tickets 
 3.create card 
 4.delete card 
 5.Travellers History
